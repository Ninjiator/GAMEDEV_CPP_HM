📈 General Observations:
# 🔍 Analysis of Multithreaded `std::vector` Summation in C++

## 🧩 Table Structure:
- **Vector Sizes** tested: `10,000` to `100,000,000` elements
- **Thread Counts**:
  - `1` (single-threaded)
  - `2`
  - `hardware_concurrency()` — number of logical CPU cores (6 in my pC)
  - `hardware_concurrency() * 2` 
- **Metrics**:
  - `Time`: Execution time in seconds  
  - `Boost`: Speedup compared to single-threaded execution

---

## 📈 General Observations:

### 🔹 Small vector sizes (10,000 – 100,000):
- Single-threaded execution is **the fastest**
- Multithreading performs **worse** due to overhead (thread creation, synchronization)
- `Boost` is `< 1` or approximately `1`
- ✅ **Multithreading is not beneficial** here

### 🔹 Medium vector sizes (1,000,000 – 10,000,000):
- `hardware_concurrency()` shows **noticeable speedup** (`Boost` ≈ 1.4–1.5)
- `2 × hardware_concurrency()` gives **less gain or worse performance**
- ❗ Diminishing returns due to context switching and resource contention

### 🔹 Large vector size (100,000,000):
- **Best performance** with `hardware_concurrency()` (`Boost` ≈ 1.58)
- `2 × hardware_concurrency()` adds **no value** and may **hurt performance**

## ✅ Summary:

- ✅ **Multithreading is beneficial for large workloads** (≥ 1 million elements)
- 🔧 **Optimal thread count is equal to the number of logical CPU cores**
- ⚠️ **Using more threads than cores often reduces performance**
- 🚫 **For small datasets, single-threaded execution is more efficient**
